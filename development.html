                Compass is a sample android application which implements trivial compass functionality. It was created just as a code snippet reuse in some of my projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main feature of the compass is noise filter (Low-pass filter) which make the arrow more stable in comparison to other similar applications where arrow always trembles.
