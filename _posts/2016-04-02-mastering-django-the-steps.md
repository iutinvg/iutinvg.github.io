title: Mastering Django, the Steps
---

Ok, you have faced Python at some point. You decided it might be awesome to
use it in your job. Probably, you already get on well with its syntax. And now
you are about to follow one of the main principles of the pros: "master your tools",
which is a journey with an indefinite destination.

Unsurprisingly, the first steps are the most complicated because the choice is
too wide and probablity to waste a lot of time sorting out garbage is high.

This article is mostly about books. There are also a couple of tips which could
be useful. But the primary objective is get a list of really good books which worked
for me. And I hope it will for you to make a start your route.

**The first step**, however, is not a book to read, but to start your own project.
Of course if you are not a lucky guy who already has a commercial project where
Python is used. So if you are not you have to create a project which would give
practice on regular basic and which will be a source of **real** problems.
I strongly believe just reading having no practice is wasting of time.

**The second step** is to obtain basic knowledge about standard Python features and
libraries. No, not all of them, but I would start with:

* list / dictionary comprehensions
* generators
* decorators and functools
* collections
* itertools

Authors of the most books below suppose you already fine with it. So it will be
very hard to read them without comprehension of the notions above. Besides, you
will enjoy the temptation to change the whole codebase of the project you are working
on at the moment as you get better with these awesome tools.

**Python in Practice, by Mark Summerfield**: what an amazing book! This is why I love
this book: it's quite short and full of deep enough explanations of the programming
technics on the whole. The author describes and compares the design patterns as deep as
it's really necessery. Neiher too shallow to be misterious, nor too profoundly to be boring.
Yes, definitely it's number one in my list.

**Test-Driven Development with Python. Obey the Testing Goat: Using Django, Selenium, and JavaScript by Harry J.W. Percival** You, probably have seen a lot of blogs and articles where
authors tells how it's thrilling to ensure that

<pre>
a = 1 + 1
self.assertEqual(2, a)
</pre>

is not failing. Hell yes, it's awesome. Apart the fact it's useless and explains nothing just because
it's disconnected from any real problem you face daily doing your job. The book by Harry J.W. Percival is very far from this misarable "unit-test library reviews". The book explains
how to deal with real problems you get during testing. But you will also know about
the test-driven design approach which might change your way for building apps tremendously.
