title: Redmine vs Trac
---

Yeah, yet another article about regarding this silent battle. And this is about why I choose Trac.

One of the main argues for redmine is multiproject support. Trac doesn't support it.
That's why my initial decision was to use redmine.
But wait a second... What is *multiproject support*? And why it could be necessary?

Different project involves:

* different people
* different repository
* other technologies
* other hosting
* ... you can continue yourself

So what benefits could I get tracking all projects in one place?
Only one: less efforts to install new trac environment.
And I think you shouldn't consider it seriously. Because it is just great to
have an ability to install the latest version of software, setup only necessary plugins,
perform configuration which works best for this particular project.

At same time trac is easier to setup. That's why I have conluded to go with trac.
